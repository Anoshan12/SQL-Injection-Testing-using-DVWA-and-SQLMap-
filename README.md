# 🔐 SQL Injection Testing with DVWA on Kali Linux

This repository contains documentation and insights from a practical project on identifying and exploiting **SQL Injection vulnerabilities** using the **Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)** on a **Kali Linux** environment.

## 📘 Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the detection and exploitation of SQL Injection vulnerabilities in a safe and legal environment. We used DVWA, a purposefully vulnerable PHP/MySQL web application, combined with tools like `sqlmap` to simulate real-world attacks and learn ethical hacking practices.

## 💻 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Kali Linux** (Virtual Machine)
- **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)**
- **XAMPP / Apache Server**
- **MySQL**
- **sqlmap** (Automated SQL Injection Tool)
- **Burp Suite** (Optional - for HTTP interception)

## 🧪 Key Steps Performed

1. ✅ Set up DVWA on localhost via XAMPP and configured the database.
2. ✅ Navigated to the SQL Injection vulnerability section.
3. ✅ Intercepted vulnerable parameters using Burp Suite.
4. ✅ Ran SQL injection tests using `sqlmap` on the identified parameters.
5. ✅ Explored methods to bypass security mechanisms like WAF using tamper scripts and headers.
6. ✅ Analyzed responses and retrieved database information successfully.

## 📝 What You’ll Learn

- How to safely set up a vulnerable web environment for learning.
- How SQL Injection works and why it's dangerous.
- How to use `sqlmap` to automate detection and exploitation.
- How to interpret the output of security tools and tweak options for deeper testing.
- Basics of web app security testing and ethical hacking methodologies.

## 📎 Documentation

A detailed step-by-step report of the process is available in the [`SQL_Injection_Documentation_DVWA.docx`](./SQL_Injection_Documentation_DVWA.docx) file.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

> This project is strictly for **educational purposes** and was conducted in a **legal, local, and isolated environment**. Never attempt SQL injection or any form of hacking on real-world systems without proper authorization.
